# napkinXC experiments

This directory contains scripts to replicate experiments from following papers:
* `plt_jmlr` - [Probabilistic Label Trees for Extreme Multi-label Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11218)
* `oplt_aistats` - [Online probabilistic label trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04451)
* `psplt_sigir` - Propensity-scored Probabilistic Label Trees

It uses combination of Bash and Python scripts, each file contains one kind of experiment
